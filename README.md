## About & Our Project 📖
The Ocean Cleanup is an organization with the goal of making the ocean plastic-free. They do this by deploying interceptors in the ocean and at river mouths. These interceptors catch plastic waste. The Ocean Cleanup wants to inform people about what they are doing. Therefore, our project was to create a dashboard for The Ocean Cleanup that provides information about these interceptors. This assignment was created for students at the Frontend Design & Development program at HVA.
